#### This is an app for CFI's and student pilots to track student progress and flight planning.  It allows students and instructors to communicate more easily.  



#### CSS was definitely a win.  CRUD was a challenge.  I learned a lot about all of these technologies during the process of building this app.  I especially learned a lot about how to troubleshoot errors!

### Technologies used include: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Heroku,  Google Cloud Platform & Google OAuth.

#### AAU- I want to make a list of flight plans.  I want to be able to post flights/airports/remarks.  I want to be able to see each individual plan, and edit the enroute/alternate airports as well.  I want to be able to make comments on how a lesson went, and want others to be able to reply with comments as well.  A way to put a grade with a comment would be an added bonus.  Weather, airport information, approach procedures, and navigation charts would be a nice bonus installed as an API, but links would work almost as well for this application.  

##### Please note I was instructed to change my Github repository, so the majority of commits are missing. 

#### Icebox items include: Implementing API's instead of links, and adding new features. 
### App's landing page:

You can see if a new flight has been posted without signing in.  Other features are restricted until the user logs into Google OAuth.  
### Add enroute or alternate airports:

### See the details of a flight, add/delete comments, rate the lesson:
