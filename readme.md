This is an app for CFI's and student pilots to track student progress and flight planning.  It allows students and instructors to communicate more easily.  

Technologies used include: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Heroku,  Google Cloud Platform & Google OAuth.

CSS was definitely a win.  CRUD was a challenge.  I learned a lot about all of these technologies during the process of building this app.  I especially learned a lot about how to troubleshoot errors!
